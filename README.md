### BackStory

I was coaching a young lady who had just started her secondary school journey,
On that day, I was helping her get around her new PC her parent bought for her.
Then she asked to keep a library on her Laptop. The only default App installed
was notepad. I knew there are online apps to use and download but I also remembered
I have noticed young girls love to keep libraries and usually make them private
So I saw this as an opportunity to develop an popular Diray for them usable on all
platforms but first starting with web app.
